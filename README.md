# 🧠 Machine Learning Projects in Python

Welcome to **Machine Learning Projects in Python** — a collection of end-to-end ML projects built by me while learning and mastering machine learning.
This repository covers a wide range of projects from **beginner-friendly basics** to **advanced, production-grade implementations**, making it useful for:

* 🎓 **Beginners** who want simple examples to get started.
* 👨‍💻 **Intermediate learners** looking to explore more real-world problems.
* 🔬 **Advanced practitioners** who want to dive into challenging ML workflows.

Whether you’re preparing for interviews, building your ML portfolio, or just experimenting — this repo is designed to **learn, practice, and showcase skills** in ML using Python.
